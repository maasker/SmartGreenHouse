This repository contains the Smart Greenhouse Watering System microprocessor project, which leverages a PIC16F877A to continuously monitor soil moisture and ambient light, detect water presence to prevent pump dry-run, and automatically control a water pump for precise irrigationâ€”ensuring the greenhouse remains optimally hydrated under all conditions.
